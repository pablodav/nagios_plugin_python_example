Introduction
============

Draft to provide one simple and one complete example to develop nagios plugins with python

Existing tutorials looks old  
Existing modules like:  
http://pythonhosted.org/nagiosplugin/tutorial/check_load.html
http://python-nagios-helpers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html

And also pynag, looks old, doesn't fully supports python3 in some cases or they are too complicated to create plugins. Also some of them add ugly and big dependencies.

Basic

See [basic](basic/basic_plugin.py)

Complete

Not implemented yet, but will use example base:  https://github.com/pablodav/sharepoint_health_mon_plugin
